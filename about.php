        <h1>About SUSHI KO</h1>
        <p>
            SUSHI KO was founded by two passionate chefs, Han and Steve, who began their culinary journey in Korea.
            After spending years mastering the art of sushi and traditional Japanese cuisine in their homeland, their love for food and service brought them to the United States. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Since opening SUSHI KO, Han and Steve have been dedicated to creating an unforgettable dining experience. 
            Their vision is simple: to serve the finest Japanese cuisine with a commitment to community and hospitality. 
            Every dish is prepared with precision, ensuring that every guest who walks through the doors feels the warmth of family and the excitement of a memorable meal.

            Han and Steve believe that food is more than just sustenance—it’s about bringing people together. 
            That’s why, at SUSHI KO, they strive to create an atmosphere where every guest feels welcomed, and where every meal is an opportunity to connect with the community.

            Their journey from Korea to the United States wasn’t just about following their passion for food—it was about sharing that passion with the world. 
            Omakase is their dream realized, and they are honored to share it with all who dine here.
